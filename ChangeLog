2011-03-22 version 0.21

new features:
- function expectile.noncross added that uses quadratric programming with constraints
- function expectile.cdf added that estimates a CDF from an 'expectreg' object

changes:
- optimising kriging and radial basis computation
- expectile plots only with the use of S3method
- formula evaluation not based on GlobalEnv anymore

bugfixes:
- correcting penalty matrices for non-centered basis
- sheets now plot correctly and return an appropriate object
- correcting sheet intercept in additive models and centered bases

2011-02-24 version 0.20

new features:
- functions (d,p,q,r,e)emq replace the 'koenker' distribution functions, being more general
- function plot.expectreg now also works for boosting
- introducing a 'by' argument for varying coefficients in function base
- function quant.bundle added
- print method for class 'expectreg' added
- predict method for base and therefore for class 'regbase' added

changes:
- boosting results now really seperate for each covariate
- not centering bases is now recognised by expectile.(laws,restricted,bundle,sheets)
- base now returns an object of class 'regbase'
- fixed smoothing option renamed from 'none' to 'fixed'
- schall algorithm returns warning if no convergence is achieved
- vignette is now available via call: 'vignette("expectreg")'

bugfixes:
- correcting the plot function for the 'expectreg' class
- correcting theoretical expectiles of gamma (and therefore exponential, chi squared), lognormal
- user defined covariate basis of type 'special' added to output

2010-09-07 version 0.16

new features: 
- function expectile.sheets added
- function bundle.density and plot method added
- functions for theoretical expectiles of: student-t, gamma, exponential, chi squared, lognormal added

changes:
- functions expectile.restricted and expectile.bundle ready for density estimation using bundle.density
- centering bases in function base is now optional
- adding parametric effects to the regression functions
- possibility to choose set of expectiles that are computed

bugfixes:
- correcting schall smoothing for additive models
- fixing schall and ACV smoothing for bundle
- covariates are now returned in correct sorting
